# fewd-techdegree-project-2

07-04-2018: These files are a part of Stephen Anim's submission for the "Mobile First Responsive Layout" Front-End Web Development Techdegree project.

Layout: A flexbox approach was used instead of floats due to Guil Hernandez's statement in the "CSS Flexbox Layout" course that the flexbox was designed specifically for layouts while floats were originally designed for wrapping text around images. Also, I see myself using the flexbox more often that floats in the future and wanted more practice. This was a great exercise.

Mobile-First Approach: The main CSS styles are for mobile view. The first media query begins at 768px for tablet width and wider, and the second adds modifications at 1024px for desktop screens and wider.
